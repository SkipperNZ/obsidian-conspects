## CLASSIC NLP

- **TF-IDF  & ML (8/8)**
    - [ ]  1. Write **TF-IDF** from scratch.

    - [ ]  2. What is normalization in **TF-IDF**?
        - ***answer***
            
            TF-IDF normalization can be understood within the framework of the function itself. TF stands for term frequency in the document. In longer documents, TF values can be higher simply because there are more words in the document.
            
            *Normalization by document length allows us to consider a word like "cat," which appears 10 times in a 1000-word text, as important as a word like "cat" that appears 5 times in a 500-word text.*
            
            [Resource](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-benefit-of-normalization-in-the-tf-idf-algorithm)
            
            In the TF-IDF vectorizer in sklearn, we can also use normalization after calculating all the scores. If we use l2 normalization, we can use cosine similarity between two vectors as a dot product.

    - [ ]  3. Why do you need to know about **TF-IDF** in our time, and how can you use it in complex models?
        - ***answer***
            
            TF-IDF can be used for testing initial hypotheses about classification. It's a fast and simple way of text vectorization, so hypothesis testing will be very quick.
            
            Additionally, TF-IDF is used for feature extraction, as each value in the vectors can be seen as the importance of a word. Thus, we can use TF-IDF in:
            
            1. Topic modeling to extract the most important representations from a large number of words.
                - [Topic modelling](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/ctfidf/ctfidf.html)
            2. Utilizing it for classification alongside BERT-like models in various applications. For instance, adding it to the vector.

    - [ ]  4. Explain how Naive Bayes works. What can you use it for?
        - ***answer***
            
            Naive Bayes is a group of algorithms based on Bayes' theorem, which states:
            
            $$
            P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
            $$
            
            - *P*(*A*∣*B*) is the probability of hypothesis A given evidence B (posterior probability).
            - 𝑃(𝐵∣𝐴)*P*(*B*∣*A*) is the probability of evidence B given hypothesis A (likelihood).
            - 𝑃(𝐴)*P*(*A*) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.
            - 𝑃(𝐵)*P*(*B*) is the prior probability of evidence B.
            - example
                
                *Two batches of products arrived at the warehouse: the first – 4000 pieces, the second – 6000 pieces. The average percentage of non-standard products in the first batch is 20%, and in the second – 10%. A randomly selected product from the warehouse turned out to be standard. Find the probability that it is from the first batch.*
                
                $$
                P(B) = \frac{4000}{6000 + 4000} = 0.4 
                $$
                
                ***P(B) - probability that the product is from the first batch***
                
                ---
                
                $$
                P(A) = (1 - 0.2) * 0.4 + (1 - 0.1) * 0.6 = 0.32 + 0.54 = 0.86
                $$
                
                ***P(A) - the total probability that the product is standard***
                
                ---
                
                $$
                P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(standard - first batch) \cdot P(standard)}{P(first batch)} = \frac{ (1 - 0.2) \cdot 0.86}{0.4} = \frac {16}{43}
                $$
                
                [link](http://mathprofi.ru/formula_polnoj_verojatnosti_formuly_bajesa.html)
                
            
            **Most often, Naive Bayes is used for text classification, considering:**
            
            - Bag of Words assumption: word order does not matter.
            - Conditional Independence assumption: words are independent of each other.
            
            Examples:
            
            ![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*goLqMbYV1GAt_iBkZOvdDQ.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*goLqMbYV1GAt_iBkZOvdDQ.png)
            
            Additional question to consider: What if we haven't seen word x in document k? Then the probability will be 0, and the probability of the entire document will also be 0.
            
    - [ ]  5. How can SVM be prone to overfitting?
        - ***answer***
            
            For SVM, we can use various kernel functions, but using a too complex kernel function can lead to overfitting.
            
            In the classical case, instability to noise is also possible: one of the drawbacks may affect the separating hyperplane. Outliers in the training data become support vectors and directly influence the construction of the separating hyperplane.
            
            **Regularization**: The regularization parameter controls the balance between achieving high accuracy on training data and maintaining model simplicity. Too low a value can lead to overfitting.

    - [ ]  6. Explain possible methods for text preprocessing (**lemmatization** and **stemming**). What algorithms do you know for this, and in what cases would you use them?
        - ***answer***
            
            Lemmatization is the process of preparing data where a word is brought to its base dictionary form (root). For example, "doing," "went," "gone" → "go."
            
            On the other hand, stemming is also a text normalization process, but in this case, the ending of a word is removed until a certain form is formed. Various methods are used for this, such as SnowballStemmer, PorterStemmer, and others. A significant drawback is that the word after stemming may become unreal and may not be encountered elsewhere.

    - [ ]  7. What metrics for text similarity do you know?
        - ***answer***
            
            In custom tasks, we can divide metrics for text similarity into two types: lexical and semantic.
            
            Lexical examples: Jaccard similarity.
            
            Semantic examples: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance.

    - [ ]  8. Explain the difference between **cosine similarity** and cosine distance. Which of these values can be negative? How would you use them?
        - ***answer***
            
            Cosine similarity/distance is a metric that indicates how similar or dissimilar two vectors (embeddings) are to each other. Essentially, it measures the angle between two vectors.
            
            **Cosine similarity range, -1 to 1:**
            -1: Absolutely dissimilar vectors *(e.g., python - security of code)*
            0: No correlation *(e.g., university knowledge - work)*
            1: Absolutely similar *(e.g., chatgpt - hype)*
            
            **Cosine distance = 1 - cosine similarity**
            
            **Range 0 to 2:**
            0: Identical vectors
            1: No correlation
            2: Absolutely different
            
            Cosine similarity - how similar vectors are
            Cosine distance - how dissimilar they are

            - **precision** = How much can we trust the prediction of pregnancy?
            - **recall** = Out of all pregnant women, how many did we actually guess correctly?

            \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP + FP}}
            
            $$
            
            So, for us, precision is a measure where we don’t want to include anything extra (for example, a couple of pregnant men), while recall is a measure so that we don’t classify all women as pregnant indiscriminately. In the case of a perfect classifier, we won’t have any pregnant men or incorrect diagnoses.
            
            If the outcomes of the classifier don’t cost us much money/moral convictions, then we can afford to lose in precision. For example, when we have small costs for potential clients, and we are ready to offer our services not directly to the target audience.
            
            The balance between these two metrics can be maintained through the F1 score.
            
    - [ ]  10. In what case would you observe changes in **specificity**?
        - ***answer***
            - **Sensitivity** = tp / (tp + fn) — the number of sick patients correctly identified as sick compared to the total number of sick patients but classified as healthy
            - **Specificity** = tn / (fp + tn) — the number of healthy patients classified as healthy compared to the total number of healthy patients, including those classified as sick
            
            Essentially, sensitivity is recall: how well the model detects sick patients. Specificity is also recall, but concerning the negative class, how well the model detects healthy patients.
            
            In short:
            
            - Recall — the proportion of sick class objects detected by the algorithm out of all sick individuals
            - Specificity — the proportion of healthy class objects detected by the algorithm out of all healthy individuals
            - Precision — how many truly sick individuals the algorithm identified out of all those it labeled as sick
            
            Roughly speaking, we have different denominators: in the case of recall and specificity, we divide by what is actually in the data; in precision, we divide by the number of examples given by the model.
            
            So, the question of when we would look at **specificity arises when it’s important for us to correctly determine the negative class**. For example, when we want to administer medication to everyone identified as sick by the model, but the medication has many side effects, so we want to perfectly identify healthy patients.
            
    - [ ]  11. When would you look at macro, and when at micro metrics? Why does the weighted metric exist?
        - ***answer***
            - **Macro** metrics are calculated separately for each class and then averaged. This is useful when all classes are equally important.
            - **Micro** metrics are calculated based on the sum of all true positives, false positives, and false negatives. This is useful when individual predictions matter. With micro-average, you can see the impact of class imbalance.
            - **Weighted** metrics are used when classes are unbalanced, and you want to consider the number of samples in each class when calculating the average.
            
            Examples of calculation:
            
            ![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*0pu2WsG-9yDHbSdNS1yrUQ.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*0pu2WsG-9yDHbSdNS1yrUQ.png)
            
            As the figure shows, a micro-average is dominated by the more frequent class (in this case, spam), since the counts are pooled. The macro-average better reflects the statistics of the smaller classes, and so is more appropriate when performance on all the classes is equally important.
            
    - [ ]  12. What is perplexity? What can we consider it with?
        - ***answer***
            
            Perplexity is the confusion a model experiences when generating a new sentence. For example, when you are fluent in a language, you don’t struggle to choose the right word, but as a beginner, you may need to try several options and look them up in a dictionary. Similarly, with a language model.
            
            Perplexity is an intrinsic metric, as it doesn’t denote the performance on a specific task but simply indicates ‘how good the language is’.
            
            Mathematically, you can compute the metric through:
            
            - Probability on the test set, meaning how confidently the model performs on the test data
            - Exponential cross-entropy — here, following the same scheme of the number of words among which the model chooses or the weighted branching factor. An excellent article on computation.
            
            Rule: the lower the perplexity, the better, interpreted as ‘the less the model hesitates, the better’.

    - [ ]  13. What is the **BLEU** metric?
        - ***answer***
            
            BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating machine translation. It compares machine-translated text to one or more reference translations, taking into account the accuracy of word choice and grammatical correctness.
            
            $$
            p_n = \frac{\sum_{\text{n-gram} \in \text{hypothesisCountmatch}} \text{match}(n\text{-gram})}{\sum_{\text{n-gram} \in \text{hypothesisCount}} \text{match}(n\text{-gram)}}
                 = \frac{\sum_{\text{n-gram} \in \text{hypothesisCountmatch}} \ell_{\text{n-gram}}^\text{hyp}}{\sum_{\text{n-gram} \in \text{hypothesisCount}} \ell_{\text{n-gram}}^\text{hyp}}
            
            $$
            
            According to the formula, BLEU calculates the ratio of matching n-grams to all n-grams in the hypothesis (generated text).
            The final formula is a weighted average over different types of n-grams, taking into account BP - brevity penalty. This parameter allows limiting hypotheses (generated texts) longer than the source text. However, for translation tasks, this is not always relevant.
            The function for n-gram word precision across all sentences combined with brevity penalty.
            
            $$
            \text{BLEU}_N = \text{BP} \cdot \exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \log p_n\right)
            $$
            
            $$
            \text{BP} = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if } \ell_{\text{hyp}} > \ell_{\text{ref}} \\e^{1 - \frac{\ell_{\text{ref}}}{\ell_{\text{hyp}}}} & \text{if } \ell_{\text{hyp}} \leq \ell_{\text{ref}}\end{cases}
            $$
            
            Constraints: Because BLEU is a word-based metric, it is very sensitive to word tokenization, making it impossible to compare different systems if they rely on different tokenization standards, and doesn’t work as well in languages with complex morphology.

                ROUGE-L measures the **longest common subsequence (LCS - the sequence in the same order but not necessarily continuous)** between the candidate text and the reference text. It computes the precision, recall, and F1-score based on the length of the LCS. 
                
                Can be extended with ROUGE-W, that assigns more weight to consecutive LCSes. 
                
                $$
                \text{ROUGE-L}_{\text{recall}} = \frac{\text{LCS}(\text{cand., ref.})}{\text{\#words in ref.}}

                ROUGE-S is a skip-gram concurrence metric: it considers n-grams that appear in the reference text and allows the words **to be separated by one** or more words in the model output (but they must still appear in order).
                
                N - number of unigrams to skip 
                
                For example:
                *Police killed the gunman - gives such skip-grams: (“police killed”, “police the”, “police gunman”, “killed the”, “killed gunman”, “the gunman”) N = 2* 
                
                Then we calculate the same skip-grams for generated summaries and make the same calculation.

            Let’s take a single layer RNN network as an example. In it, we have gates. Each gate has weight matrices 
            
            $$

        - ***answer***
            1. **Vanishing gradient over time** - refers to the main challenge in using RNNs—the problem of solving long-term dependencies. However, when performing backpropagation through time, the gradient does not reach the initial time steps in long sequences.
            2. **Longer training - parallelization methods are not easily applicable** 
                
                > *Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht as a function of the previous hidden state h(t-1). This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.*

                **input gate -** decided what info should be added to the cell state 
                
                1. updates the cell state given the previous 
                2. given hidden state and the current input. 
                
                **output gate** - The output gate decides what the next hidden state should be based on the previous hidden state, current input and modified cell state. 
                
                Remember that the hidden state contains information on previous inputs. The hidden state is also used for predictions. 
                
            
            GRU 
            
            merges forget and input gate as an update gate 
            
            *At each time step, the GRU computes a “candidate activation vector” that combines information from the input and the previous hidden state. This candidate vector is then used to update the hidden state for the next time step.*
            
            - update gate - forget + input gate → what info to throw away from the current info and what info to add
            - reset gate - how much of the previous hidden state to forget according to the current input - how much the previous hidden state is reset.
            
            В GRU мы объединили единое скрытое состояние для передачи информации, в то время как у LSTM было два состояния: отдельное ячейки и общее скрытое состояние. 
            Таким образом, GRU имеет меньше параметров и часто обучается быстрее.

    - [ ]  29. What parameters can we tune in such networks? (Stacking, number of layers)
        - ***answer***
            1. Number of layers 
            2. Bi-directional or not 
            3. Number of hidden units 
    - [ ]  30. What are vanishing gradients for RNN? How do you solve this problem?
        - ***answer***
            
            The vanishing gradient problem means that the gradient becomes very small, making it difficult to update the parameters significantly enough to learn anything. On the other hand, the exploding gradient problem refers to the opposite situation, where the gradient becomes too large, causing the optimization to “overshoot” the minimum of the loss function.

            To address the problem, we can use more advanced networks like LSTM and GRU, as well as methods applicable to other types of networks:
            
            •	**Gradient Clipping**
            
            •	**Activation Functions**: Replace ReLU with LeakyReLU or other alternatives.
            
            > ReLU suffers from a problem known as *dying ReLUs*, where some neurons stop working and consistently output 0 as training progresses. [source](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/the-challenge-of-vanishing-exploding-gradients-in-deep-neural-networks/)
            > 
            
            •	**Batch Normalization**
            
    - [ ]  31. Why use a Convolutional Neural Network in NLP, and how can you use it? How can you compare CNN within the attention paradigm?
        - ***answer***
            
            CNNs can process text using a sliding window, which allows them to capture local patterns. This makes CNNs useful for extracting local features, such as n-grams.
